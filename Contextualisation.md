# The potential impact of instant computer image recognition

## Travel and Tourism

Within the realm of city tourism, computers might be able to use instant image recognition in order to act like a 'guide' for the user. This sort of feature has already been implemented in Google Maps, where the user can scan a street with their camera and immediately know their position on the map.
Facial recognition could however also act like a double edged sword - it can improve security at airports etc, but at the same time encourages mass surveillance, which can infringe on privacy.
Image recognition can also be used to fuel large coorporate data collection, as algorithms would be able to detect locations that users have visited, and feed them into the database about that user, in the hopes of using it to generate more personalised ads.

## Gaming and Entertainment

The Cheat market for many of the most competitive games is one that is worth tens of millions, not more. Traditional video game cheats work in various ways, such as injecting variables into the code or overriding user input. In turn, coorporations develop anticheat software, some of which directly takes control over the kernel. However, with image recognition, researchers could develop a bot that only requires visual input to then play above the level of a normal human, but still within the bounds of the game's anticheat. Machine Learning has already been used with great effect in games like Minecraft with the Baritone project to create "bot" players. In the past, AI has essentially broken the games of Chess and Go, capable of beating the best players consistently. A very well trained AI applied to more competitive video games could pose the same challenge for game companies to solve.
AR technology, which works on image recognition detecting real world objects to then interact with them in a virtual environment, also relies on insant recognition. Its use however has led to significant developments in bridging the virtual and physical worlds. Users can use apps to change the colour of the paint on their walls; see furniture in their home, or play AR games. One limitation of this however is that it only applies to smartphones, and specifically requires the user to point the camera at the subject.
Image detection can also be used in feeds for certain live event such as sports broadcasts. The trained program would be given the most clear view from all the cameras, and use that to detect the location of players, current location of balls, etc, and be able to give a live response. This would enhance the viewing experience, as well as providing servies for those who suffer from disabilites related to vision or sight.

## Education and Learning

Attendance systems could greatly be enhanced using AI face recognition. To my knowledge, this has already been done in some areas of China. Furthermore, it could be used to enforce behaviour codes, as an image recognition algorithm looking at CCTV feeds would easily be able to recognise misbehaving students. The morality of such an undertaking is however questionable - especially considering the age of those being surveillenced.
Star Tracking is a common way spacecraft navigate - they will look around and search for a specific star in the night sky, and record their rotation relative to it. Image Recognition could make this automatic.
Students with disabilites would be assisted by the ability to recognise words off a page.

## Transport and Navigation

One of the most promised uses for Image Recongition is the Self-Driving car, which would be able to drive safer than the average human while requiring no effort. While the prospect is tantalising, the concept is in reality dangerous. Hackers who gain the ability to experiment with the algorithm could reverse engineer it through trial and error, and then work out how to modify road signs to cause crashes, put objects in its view which would confuse the algorithm, etc. This could prove to be catastrophic if self-driving is released to the public too early.
A safer alternative use for image recognition in cars is GPS-less navigation. By simply scanning the environment, a car would be able to locate itself on the map.
Public Transport cards might become a thing of the past if facial recognition is used. Instead of presenting a ticket, or even a credit card at a shop, a camera would be able to immediately correlate a person with their purchased ticket or their credit card details. There are dangers however, such as similar people getting confused with one another, or ethical worries about the data being collected from facial databases.

## Medicine and Healthcare

Image Recognition could learn how to correlate certain visual cues with diseases which can't be immediately spotted by doctors. While there are simple examples, such as diagonising Jaundice based on the colour of the Sclera, there are many other conditions which could be diagnosed simply by looking at a person and searching for intricate details.
Medical Scans could gain results much faster than current pace of analysis. MRIs would be able to not just detect any abnormalities, but immediately give doctors an entire panel of details which would otherwise take an impractical amount of time to gain. There are however dangers of false positives and false negatives, which might put entire lives at stake.
